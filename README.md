# Mini Computational Linguistics Projects

This repository contains a collection of mini projects I completed while following the Udemy course:  
**"Learn the basics of Computational Linguistics and kick off your career in the field!"**

Each notebook explores a simple programming or logic exercise that builds the foundation for more advanced tasks in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computational Linguistics.

## Project List

- **Check_someone's_age.ipynb**  
  Basic conditionals and user input handling.

- **EvenorOdd.ipynb**  
  Number classification and simple logic.

- **Infinite Loop.ipynb**  
  Exploring control flow and loop structures.

- **Library_Catalogue.ipynb**  
  A toy library catalogue system demonstrating search and retrieval concepts.  
  *Includes Library_Catalogue_Photo1.*

- **The_Secret_Password.ipynb**  
  String matching and password validation logic.

- **Value between interval.ipynb**  
  Comparison and logical condition checks.

- **book_1984.ipynb**  
  Text-based analysis on *1984* by George Orwell.

## Purpose

These mini projects are **introductory exercises** designed to strengthen my foundations in programming, logic, and text handlingâ€”core skills needed in computational linguistics.  
They serve as stepping stones toward more advanced work in **NLP, IR, ASR, and LLM development**.
